To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with\n\n              the symbol <. The difference between @ and < is then that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload, while the < makes a text field and just get the contents for that text field\n\n              from a file.\n\n\n\n              Tell  curl  to  read content from stdin instead of a file by using - as filename. This goes for both @ and < constructs. When stdin is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to\n\n              determine its size and allow a possible resend.  Defining a part's data from a named non-regular file (such as a named pipe or similar) is unfortunately not subject to buffering  and  will  be\n\n              effectively read at transmission time; since the full size is unknown before the transfer starts, such data is sent as chunks by HTTP and rejected by IMAP.\n\n\n\n              Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile' is the name of the form-field to which the file portrait.jpg will be the input:\n\n\n\n               curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi\n\n\n\n              Example: send a your name and shoe size in two text fields to the server:\n\n\n\n               curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/\n\n\n\n              Example: send a your essay in a text field to the server.

When headers are read from a file, Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored; each\n\n              header can be folded by splitting between two words and starting the continuation line with a space; embedded carriage-returns and trailing spaces are stripped.  Here is an example of a header\n\n              file contents:\n\n\n\n                # This file contain two headers.\n\n                X-header-1: this is a header\n\n\n\n                # The following header is folded.\n\n                X-header-2: this is\n\n                 another header\n\n\n\n              To support sending multipart mail messages, the syntax is extended as follows:\n\n              - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character of the argument,\n\n              - if data starts with '(', this signals to start a new multipart: it can be followed by a content type specification.\n\n              - a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.\n\n\n\n              Example: the following command sends an SMTP mime e-mail consisting in an inline part in two alternative formats: plain text and HTML. It attaches a text file:\n\n\n\n               curl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \\\n\n                       -F '=plain text message' \\\n\n                       -F '= <body>HTML message</body>;type=text/html' \\\n\n                    -F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ...  smtp://example.com\n\n\n\n              Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=.
